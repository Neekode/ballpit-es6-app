Coding Practice

Finished 22 basic exercises of javascript (from w3resource.com), and have decided to create a new html practice file! Admittedly, it's only been about a month of practice. But I felt it was appropriate to create a new one 
for clean slateness. Feels like I'm starting to get adept with the basics of these clientside languages.
